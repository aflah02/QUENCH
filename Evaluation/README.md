# LLM Evaluation

This folder contains 2 files. 

- `Automatic_Metrics.py` contains our code to compute ROUGE, BLEU and BertScore
- `Eval_via_LLM.ipynb` contains code to evaluate one model's results via another judge model

You can fill in the details in the first few cells inside `Eval_via_LLM.ipynb` to quickly run results while you can import functions from `Automatic_Metrics.py` to evaluate on your own data with our implementation of these metrics.
