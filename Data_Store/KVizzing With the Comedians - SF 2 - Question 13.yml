question: "X might seem like an unlikely artistic medium, but in some Tibetan Buddhist\
  \ traditions, sculptors shape yak X into flowers, animals, and meaningful symbols\
  \ such as the dharma wheel. The sculptures, known as torma, are often made by Buddhist\
  \ monks and nuns for prayer festivals and the Tibetan New Year. Making these requires\
  \ a great deal of skill gleaned through years of practice. These sacred offerings\
  \ are moulded by hand and decorated in the most colourful ways imaginable. In a\
  \ variety of sizes \u2014 from a few centimetres to several metres \u2014 these\
  \ delicately ornate sculptures are often displayed in monasteries and temples throughout\
  \ Tibet. Xs malleable qualities and availability make it the ideal medium for sculptures\
  \ in the absence of flowers in the freezing winters."
