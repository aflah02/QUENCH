question: Within a certain category, X is one element whose name describes one of
  its general purposes. Although X can be distinguished from Y, which also belongs
  to the same category, based on certain physical properties such as size, shape and
  load bearing capacity, there is no universally accepted distinction between the
  two! The general idea is that X can carry Y but not vice-versa. Owners/Heads in-charge
  of X and Y almost always give a name to them! A word that rose to popularity during
  the past few years has Venetian origins and was originally done to X from plague-stricken
  areas!
