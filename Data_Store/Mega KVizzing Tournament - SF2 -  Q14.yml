question: X Obscura is a darkened room with a small hole or lens at one side through
  which an image is projected onto a wall or table opposite the hole. The term was
  first used in early 1600s. The X Obscura was used to study eclipses without the
  risk of damaging the eyes by looking directly into the Sun. As a drawing aid, it
  allowed tracing the projected image to produce a highly accurate representation,
  and was especially appreciated as an easy way to achieve proper graphical perspective.
