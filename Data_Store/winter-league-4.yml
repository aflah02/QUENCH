question: One of the newest capitals (X) in the world, construction of this "monarchial
  residence" began in the 21st century. This colossal megaproject remains largely
  uninhabited and draws a sharp satire with giant deserted boulevards and mammoth
  infrastructure whose access lies significantly beyond the purses of its residents.
  One of the poorest countries in the region, its decision to relocate its capital
  deeper into the mainland lies on shaky arguments of strategic positioning and defense
  against an amphibious foreign invasion. Despite many replicas of iconic monuments
  from the previous capital, the heart and people of the country elude it.

  X: "Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the SEA region. Naypyidaw, the capital\
    \ of Myanmar, is Burmese for \"abode of the king\" and is generally translated\
    \ as \"royal capital,\" \"seat of the king,\" or \"abode of kings,\" which is\
    \ similar in meaning to a \u201Cmonarchial residence.\" The capital was moved\
    \ from Yangon to Naypidaw because it is more centrally located. It is also a transportation\
    \ hub located adjacent to the Shan, Kayah, and Kayin states. Governmental and\
    \ military leaders felt that a stronger military and governmental presence nearby\
    \ might provide stability to those chronically turbulent regions."
