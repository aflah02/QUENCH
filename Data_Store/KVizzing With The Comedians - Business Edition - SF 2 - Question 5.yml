question: X, now owned by P&G, was formulated by a Unilever chemist in South Africa
  named Graham Wulff. He chose the name of the brand as X, based on Lanolin, a key
  ingredient of the product. It was unique in the early days because it was a pink
  fluid rather than a cream, packaged in a heavy glass bottle. Wulff and his marketing
  partner, Jack Lowe, a former copywriter, had tested the product on their wives and
  friends and were confident in its uniqueness and quality. X is an 'ageless' brand
