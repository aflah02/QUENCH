question: X is a traditional semi-oxidized Chinese tea produced through a process
  including withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and
  twisting. According to one theory, the term X replaced the old term when loose tea
  came into fashion. Since it was dark, long, and curly, it was called Black Dragon
  tea. Yet another tale tells of a man named Wu Liang who discovered the tea by accident
  when he was distracted by a deer after a hard day's tea-picking, and by the time
  he remembered to return to the tea it had already started to oxidize.

    withering the plant under strong sun and oxidation before curling and twisting.
    These are several theories for its creation one being about how a man named Wu
    Liang accidentally created it. Wu Liang vaguely sounds like Oolong and hence acts
    as a hint.
