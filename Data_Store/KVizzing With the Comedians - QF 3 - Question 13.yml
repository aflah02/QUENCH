question: The French were the first Europeans to settle on the island, and they signed
  a treaty with the native Caribs in 1660. England and France fought 14 times for
  control of the island. Eventually, the British took full control in 1814. Because
  the island switched so often between British and French control, it was also known
  as the "Helen of the West" after the Greek mythological character. X and Ireland
  are the only two sovereign states in the world named after a woman and X is the
  only one named after a human woman.
