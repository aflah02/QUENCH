question: In 2013, a man from America named Benjamin Carethers, believed that the
  slogan of X is dishonest and therefore sued the company on the accusation of false
  advertising! The misleading part which Benjamin used in the lawsuit was that it
  does not offer what was advertised literally or metaphorically. In 2015 when the
  lawsuit ended, customers received $13 million in compensation. The company thereafter
  altered a word in their slogan so that it 'technically' does not have a meaning
  in the dictionary.
