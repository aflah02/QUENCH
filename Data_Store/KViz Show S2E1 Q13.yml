question: X was founded in 1998 by Chip Wilson in Vancouver. Wilson created the name
  to have many 'L's so that it would sound western to Japanese buyers, who often have
  difficulty pronouncing the letter, and that the name otherwise "means nothing".
  He later remarked that he found it "funny to watch Japanese speakers try and say
  it".
