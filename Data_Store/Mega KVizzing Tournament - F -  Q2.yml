question: If you're tired of going to places to admire priceless masterpieces, make
  a trip to the MOBA in Massachusetts. MOBA is dedicated to celebrating the tacky,
  amateur creations that usually end up in second-hand stores and trash bins. Collection
  titles include "Poor Traits," "Oozing My Religion," and "In the Nood." According
  to their website, "our collection includes sincere works in which something has
  gone wrong in a way that results in compelling, interesting image. " MOBA was founded
  in the fall of 1993 and presented its first show in March 1994 . The response was
  overwhelming. Since then, MOBA's collection and ambitions have grown exponentially.
  X is the full form of MOBA.
