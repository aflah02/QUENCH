question: John Alexander Brodie, an engineer involved in the planning and design of
  New Delhi and serving as the chief engineer for the Mersey Tunnel, was also a devoted
  Everton fan. His frustration over a disallowed goal against Accrington Stanley,
  attributed to crowd interference, led him to devise a solution to address such issues.
  In 1889, he implemented this solution (X) in Stanley Park and subsequently secured
  a patent for it in the following year. This innovation, introduced by Brodie, remains
  an integral part of the game to this day.
