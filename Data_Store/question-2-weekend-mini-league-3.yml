question: Throughout recorded history, desire has driven humanity to build supremely
  majestic monuments and commitatrocities beyond the most perverse mind's remit. Enshrined
  in movies like Neon Demon, the desire for X, a quality hilariously doing the rounds
  thanks to a recent Olivia Rodrigo song, has driven people to rather unsavoury activities,
  up to and including crime. X derived at any cost has come to be termed Y X after
  a Greek man who committed a heinous crime for X.

variable_specific_rationale:
  X: X in this context refers to fame. The Neon Demon is a movie about a younger model
    and her rise to fame and the horrific actions by her co-models who are jealous
    of her success! Vampire, by Olivia Rodrigo, hints at someone taking advantage
    of her fame.
  Y: Herostratus was a Greek arsonist who sought fame by setting fire to the second
    temple of Artemis at Ephesus. This led to 'fame derived at any cost' to be termed
    as 'Herostratic fame' after Herostratus!
