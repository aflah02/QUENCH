question: In the 1950s, brothers Mervin and Jesse Levine, started the M & J Levine

  of colored ink. By 1962 the ink division was doing well while the advertising division
  was in debt. Herbert purchased the company's assets from the brothers and named
  the company X. The name X translates to 'all colors'
