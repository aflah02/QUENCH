question: After an engineering degree from IIT Kanpur and a management course from
  the 11M Ahmedabad, Deepak Mohoni worked on mainframe computing for about four years
  before he decided to start a computer graphics company. It was then that a senior
  journalist asked him if he could generate technical charts for news articles on
  companies and stock markets. In 1989, while writing in top journals including Economic
  Times and Business World, he claimed to have created this term (X) which gained
  popularity soon after.
