question: X was a prominent figure in Greek mythology and an important character in
  the Trojan War. Born to Telamon, the king of Salamis, and Periboea, he was renowned
  for his remarkable strength, unwavering courage, and exceptional combat skills.
  His story exemplifies the themes of honor, rivalry, and the consequences of pride
  and loss in ancient Greek literature and culture. Interestingly, the name X has
  also inspired a professional football club, which proudly bears his name. The club's
  emblem prominently features the portrait of X, artfully depicted with a mere 11
  lines, symbolizing the 11 players constituting a football team.
