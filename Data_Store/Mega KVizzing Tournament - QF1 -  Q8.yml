question: In the quirky world of indie games, Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett
  Foddy introduce their latest creation following the success of their prior hit,
  Ape Out. This game adopts a literal approach to walking as players guide Nate, a
  onesie-wearing character, using triggers to lift and plant each foot. Initially
  feeling the pressure to confront the world, Nate finds himself in a surreal, lonely
  land. The soundscape, a nascent musique concrete, triggers environmental sounds
  tied to players' walking, guiding them to unique discoveries. A playful game concept
  is encapsulated in the title (X), embodying Nate's journey through awkwardness,
  mistakes, and unexpected encounters, inviting players to take small and cautious
  strides towards their destination.
