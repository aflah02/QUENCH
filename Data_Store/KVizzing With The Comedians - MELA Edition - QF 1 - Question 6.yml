question: By 1988, Tinkle was already on its way to becoming the most popular children's
  magazine in India. Their biggest rival then was another children's magazine named
  Target. Unlike Tinkle, Target was more of a narrative magazine with a few pages
  of comics. Their flagship character at that time was Detective Moochwala. Tinkle
  decided to create a competing character (X). They based this new character on a
  boastful but cowardly big game in the then famous television drama, I Love Lucy.
