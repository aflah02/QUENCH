question: The game originated in the 1950s and was based on the opening and closing
  rates of cotton as transmitted to the Bombay Cotton Exchange from the New York Cotton
  Exchange, via teleprinters. In 1961, the New York Cotton Exchange stopped the practice,
  which caused the punters to look for alternative ways to keep the game alive. A
  Sindhi migrant from Karachi, Ratan Khatri, introduced the idea of declaring opening
  and closing rates of imaginary products and playing cards. Numbers would be written
  on pieces of paper and put into a large earthen pitcher. One person would then draw
  a chit and declare the winning numbers. The game has also had an influence on Bollywood.
  Prem Nath played Ratan Khatri in the Feroz Khan film Dharmatma. Khatri himself financed
  and even acted in the movie Rangila Ratan. The game is popularly known as X today
