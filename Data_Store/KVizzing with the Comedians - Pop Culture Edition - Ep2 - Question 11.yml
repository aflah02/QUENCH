question: The idea for the rippling water and rattling mirror in the tour vehicle
  was inspired by the director listening to Earth, Wind & Fire with the bass turned
  up at full volume in his car. On set, special effects supervisor Michael Lantieri
  plucked a guitar string underneath the cups to create the ripples; a vibrating motor
  above the windshield made the mirror shake. This is a famous movie's (X) iconic
  moment
