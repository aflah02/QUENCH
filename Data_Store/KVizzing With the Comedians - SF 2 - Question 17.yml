question: Frank Seiberling, the founder and former president of The XY & Rubber Company,
  deserves credit for choosing the Wingfoot symbol for X's logo. In his old home,
  there was a statue of the mythological god Mercury (known as Hermes to the Creeks).
  Seiberling believed that this god represented many of the qualities associated with
  X's products. The symbol was chosen because it symbolized speed and also conveyed
  a positive message to X's customers. The winged foot of Mercury was a symbol of
  quickness, and Mercury was seen as a bringer of good news and positive experiences
  for users of X products. The logo's yellow on blue color combination was selected
  to evoke feelings of happiness, reliability, and security.
