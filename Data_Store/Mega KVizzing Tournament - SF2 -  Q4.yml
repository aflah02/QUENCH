question: These small, porous products (X) are gaining popularity as an alternative
  to cigarettes, particularly among those seeking a tobacco free experience. These
  products, reminiscent of teabags, are meticulously designed to be placed discreetly
  between the upper lip and gums, offering a convenient and spit-free method of consumption.
  Unlike traditional tobacco products, they boast a formulation free from tobacco
  leaves, instead featuring a blend of flavorings and other fillers. Packaged in compact
  tins, they cater to diverse preferences with an array of flavors and strengths,
  typically ranging from 3mg to 12mg. Despite recent debates about potential health
  risks, notably concerning youth consumption, the market for these products has seen
  significant growth. One prominent brand, Zyn, in particular, witnessed substantial
  sales increases in the US between 2019 and 2022, with further upticks noted in 2023.
  X is a two-word term.
