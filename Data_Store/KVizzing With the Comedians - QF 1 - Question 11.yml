question: In 1927 John Williard X and his wife, Alice, purchased the rights to franchise
  an A&W root beer stand in Columbia Heights. The first summer saw brisk business,
  but as cold weather approached they realized the seasonal nature of their business
  and started selling food too. They named the restaurant Hot Shoppes, which offered
  the first drive-in service on the East Coast. This move popularized the restaurants,
  and by 1932, they owned 7 Hot Shoppes in the D.C. area and in 1953, Hot Shoppes,
  Inc. became a public company. The company opened its first hotel, the Twin Bridges
  Motor Hotel, in Virginia, in 1957 and a second hotel, the Key Bridge X in Rosslyn
  in 1959. The latter is its longest continuously operating hotel. Hot Shoppes, Inc.
  was also renamed the X Corporation in 1967.
