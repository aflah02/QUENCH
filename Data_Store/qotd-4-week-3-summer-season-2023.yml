question: A type of variation seen in some precious stones, X is most well known in
  rubies and sapphires and causes the stones to appear like the eyes of the protagonist(s)
  of a viral recent T.V. series. Caused by trace deposits of mineral Y, these variations
  are quite rare and make stones with these variations quite expensive.

variable_specific_rationale:
  TV Show: The mention of the viral recent TV series with protagonists whose eyes
    exhibit asterism likely refers to the anime series "Naruto," where characters
    like Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha possess unique eye designs known as the
    Sharingan and Rinnegan, which could be metaphorically linked to the star-like
    patterns seen in gemstones with asterism.
  X: Asterism is a phenomenon in which a star-like pattern appears on the surface
    of a gemstone, most notably in rubies and sapphires. This effect is caused by
    the presence of needle-like inclusions of minerals, such as rutile, within the
    gemstone.
  Y: Rutile is the mineral responsible for causing asterism in gemstones like rubies
    and sapphires. When rutile is present in the form of needle-like inclusions, it
    interacts with light to create the distinctive star-shaped pattern known as asterism,
    adding a unique and desirable characteristic to the precious stones.
