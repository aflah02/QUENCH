question: "X's symbol, known as \"B\xE9lo,\" is described as a representation of places,\
  \ people, love, and X itself. Unveiled in 2014, the logo takes the form of a rounded\
  \ letter with a loop in the middle, reminiscent of a location pin symbol and a person's\
  \ head. The overall shape of the emblem is designed to convey a heart and the letter.\
  \ However, the new logo faced backlash on social media, with many users suggesting\
  \ that it resembled sexual organs and other body parts. Others criticized the logo\
  \ for being too similar to that of another startup, Automation Anywhere."
