question: The author of this iconic novel (X) first came up with the idea for it after
  being beaten up on a camping trip when he complained to some nearby campers about
  the noise of their radio. When he returned to work, he was fascinated to find that
  nobody would mention or acknowledge his injuries, instead saying such commonplace
  things as "How was your weekend?" The author concluded that the reason people reacted
  this way was because if they asked him what had happened, a degree of personal interaction
  would be necessary, and his workmates simply didn't care enough to connect with
  him on a personal level. It was his fascination with this societal 'blocking' which
  became the foundation for the novel. The novel was adapted into an equally iconic
  movie in the late 1990s.
