question: The original ending of the movie X involved Neil Young. In 2015, Cameron
  Crowe told Vanity Fair that he intended for X to end on Elaine Miller (Frances McDormand)
  playing the family Neil Young's "On the Way Home." "In the end, we decided not to
  hear that song or her dialogue, and to let the sequence live in a montage as the
  Stillwater tour bus drives away to the sound of Led Zeppelin's 'Tangerine.' That
  song was more eloquent in its summary of the movie than any spoken words," Crowe
  said This Cameron Crowe's semi-autobiographical film from the year 2000 won Crowe
  an Oscar (for Best Original Screenplay).
