question: X was convinced that Johnny Fontane, a mob- associated singer in Mario Puzo's
  novel The Godfather, was based on his life. Puzo wrote in 1972 that when the author
  and X met in Chasen's, X "started to shout abuse", calling Puzo a "pimp" and threatening
  physical violence. Francis Ford Coppola, director of the film adaptation, said in
  the audio commentary that "Obviously Johnny Fontane was inspired by a kind of X
  character" X is among the world's best-selling music artists with an estimated 150
  million record sales
