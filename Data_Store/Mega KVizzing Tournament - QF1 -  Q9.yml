question: In the early 1960s, a revolutionary literary movement unfolded in Kolkata,
  India, challenging established norms in literature, language, and art. Spearheaded
  by Shakti Chattopadhyay, Malay Roy Choudhury, Samir Roychoudhury, and Debi Roy,
  the movement aimed to disrupt colonial canons, becoming a pioneering voice of post-colonial
  freedom of expression. At its core, the movement embraced Oswald Spengler's idea
  of History, asserting that an ailing culture feeds on cultural elements brought
  from outside. According to these writers, Bengali culture had reached its zenith
  and was now sustained by alien influences, akin to living on "alien food." Notable
  writers and artists, including Utpal Kumar Basu also joined this avant-garde cultural
  revolution. This movement is known as the "X Generation"
