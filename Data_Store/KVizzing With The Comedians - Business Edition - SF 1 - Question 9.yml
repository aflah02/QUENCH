question: "Z wanted to sign with X when he was drafted in 1984. Distributors reportedly\
  \ wanted to make it happen, but executives wanted taller players to represent the\
  \ brand on court. Converse was ready to offer him $100,000 per year. Y, a well-known\
  \ rival of X, offered Z a $500,000 per year contract, which he took back to X to\
  \ see if they could \"come anywhere close,\" but the brand had to pass. Z signed\
  \ with Y. Missing out on Z was\u2014and still is\u2014one of the biggest missteps\
  \ in X's history, but the company had its share of smart plays, too. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar\
  \ was one of the brand's first contracted player, while Stan Smith made sales soar\
  \ when he signed on and got a silhouette named after him. X & Y are companies and\
  \ Z is a person"
