question: X's family was chock-full of lawyers, and the budding intellectual was expected
  to join them. He studied law at the University of Poitiers and even came home with
  a law degree in 1616. But he never entered the practice. In 1618, a 22-year-old
  X enlisted as a mercenary in the Dutch States Army instead. There, he would study
  military engineering and become fascinated with math and physics. In 1618, the Emperor
  of the Holy Roman Empire, Ferdinand 11, attempted to impose Catholicism on anybody
  living within his domain. The result of this policy would be the Thirty Years' War.
  It would also prompt X, a Catholic, to switch allegiances to a Bavarian army fighting
  for the Catholic side. But on his travels, he stopped in the town of Ulm. There,
  on the night of November 10, he had three dreams that convinced him to change his
  life's path. "X took from them the message that he should set out to reform all
  knowledge," philosopher Gary Hatfield writes in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.
