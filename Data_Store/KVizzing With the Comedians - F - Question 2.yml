question: X got his derogatory nickname "Avida Dollars" (avid for dollars), as a derisive
  reference to the increasing commercialization of his work. Yoko Ono wanted a piece
  of X that she could call her own. X's close friend and muse Amanda Lear recalls
  how he duped Yoko Ono, selling her a blade of grass for $10,000. "X thought that
  Yoko Ono was a witch and might use it in a spell. He didn't want to send her a personal
  item, much less one of his hairs," Lear explained. "So he sent me to the garden
  to find a dry blade of grass, and sent it off in a nice presentation box. The idiot
  paid 10,000 dollars for it. It amused him to rip people off."
