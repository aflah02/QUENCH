question: 'On more than one occasion, Barack Obama has cited X as one of his favorite
  TV shows. Interestingly, during the 2008 presidential election, the show''s greatness
  was one of the few things that both John McCain and Obama could agree on, with McCain
  mentioning X alongside Seinfeld as a personal favorite. And Obama''s favorite character?
  It''s pretty much everyone''s favorite character: the gay, drug dealer-robbing,
  criminal code- having, Robin Hooding stick-up boy Omar. "That''s not an endorsement.
  He''s not my favorite person, but he''s a fascinating character," Obama told adding
  that he''s "the toughest, baddest guy on the show."'
