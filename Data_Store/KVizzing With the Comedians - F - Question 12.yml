  to a grinding halt at 8.30 pm in Afghanistan. People did not take telephone calls
  and most of the mobiles were switched off, even marriage ceremonies were programmed
  in a way that the guests were able to watch the soap. Two separate TV sets, one
  each for the male and female guests were installed in marriage venues and all activity
  was stopped for half an hour.
