question: Xs have some of the most dexterous hands in nature. Native Americans were
  the first to note their unusual paws. The English word X comes from the Powhatan
  word aroughcun, which means "animal that scratches with its hands." The Aztecs went
  in a similar direction when naming the X mapachitli, or "one who takes everything
  in its hands." Today mapache means "X" in Spanish.
