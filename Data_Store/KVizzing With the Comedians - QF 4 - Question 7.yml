question: "In baseball, a X is a ticket issued to spectators which admits them to\
  \ the ballpark at a later date at no additional cost to its holder. It is issued\
  \ if a game is cancelled due to a particular reason. The practice has been recorded\
  \ since the 1870s \u2014 though it did not become generally established until the\
  \ 20th century - and today the term is used to refuse an offer politely, but imply\
  \ that it can be taken up later."
