question: In the world of advertising, the use of celebrity endorsements can vary
  depending on the product being promoted. Nestle, known for its inclusive approach,
  often opts not to rely on celebrity endorsements. Instead, they prioritize relatable
  narratives that resonate with everyday consumers. Take, for instance, their Nescafe
  campaign targeted at the Southern region. They enlisted the help of a well-known
  figure (X) from the cricketing world, someone recognized for his versatility and
  adaptability. Despite the stereotype, this individual wasn't a typical Mumbaikar;
  rather, his roots traced back to Bangalore. In the ad, he proudly declares, 'l am
  from Bombay, my family is from Bangalore and we understand coffee.' Through this
  campaign, Nestle effectively demonstrated the universality of their product while
  celebrating regional diversity.
