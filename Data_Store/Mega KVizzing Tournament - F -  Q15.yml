question: In 1981, X was cast in one of his first major acting roles as the lead in
  a made-for-television film titled Introducing ... Janet. Airing on the Canadian
  Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), the film sees the 19-year-old X playing an aspiring
  comedian named Tony Maroni who befriends a woman (Adah Glassbourg) struggling with
  insecurity. At the time, X said it was unusual for him to portray a comedian who
  was bad at impressions when he was actually very good at them. In 1995, the film
  was released on home video under the title Rubberface to try and capitalize on X's
  newfound fame.
