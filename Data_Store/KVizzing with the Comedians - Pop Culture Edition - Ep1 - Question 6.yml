question: 'Inspired by the Hollywood weepie ''No Man of Her Own'' (1950), Shakti Samanta''s
  1970 film X addresses the still-taboo theme of widows remarrying. The film goes
  out of its way to proclaim the untainted virgin status of its female lead, as Madhu
  only pretends to be a widow in order to assume a new identity. Complications follow
  when she is attracted to her ''dead'' husband''s best mate. The real superstar of
  this melodramatic film is RD Burman''s classic score: every track remains popular
  to this day'
