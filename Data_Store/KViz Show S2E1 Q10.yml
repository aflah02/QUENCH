question: X is thought to have had its roots in Italy where the gambling game sprang
  up in the early 18th century. The king of Naples and Sicily wanted to formalize
  lottery in order to be able to tax it. The Church, however, opposed this as it was
  considered a "deceptive and amoral delight". Eventually it was legalized as long
  as the game was suspended during the Christmas holidays, so as not to distract the
  faithful from prayer. The Neapolitans didn't want to give up playing, so they adapted
  this lottery to a board game X with a familiar character. X is a derivative of a
  word that means "to fall headlong or tumble".
