question: 'These stone throats were inspired by a European dragon folk tale encouraging
  conversion to Christianity. These were often spotted on church pillars and cleverly
  served a two-found purpose for the clergy: 1) to inspire a visual fear of the horrors
  of hell in the largely illiterate Medieval European populace and portray the safety
  from them that their faith provides 2) to encourage conversion to Christianity as
  they were often shaped in the form of pagan gods to make the churches seem more
  familiar and welcoming to pagan worshippers Name this Gothic architectural concept
  designed to protect the work of men from the wrath of heaven (X).'

variable_specific_rationale:
  X: Gargoyles are stone carvings of grotesque creatures that were often placed on
    church pillars and other architectural features of Gothic churches. They were
    intended to inspire a sense of fear in the largely illiterate Medieval European
    population, reminding them of the horrors of hell and the need for salvation through
    Christianity. They were often shaped in the form of pagan gods or other mythological
    creatures, making the churches seem more familiar and welcoming to pagan worshippers.
    They were also seen as protecting the work of men (the church building) from the
    wrath of heaven.
