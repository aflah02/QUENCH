question: X, a science fiction movie released in 1989, was a breakthrough in visual
  effects. It was written and directed by James Cameron, in collaboration with Lightstorm
  Entertainment. One of the notable achievements of the film was its utilization of
  complex computer-generated images (CGI), particularly in the creation of a sea creature
  known as the pseudopod. This pseudopod character was the first-ever fully computer-generated
  3D character in a film. X won the Academy Award for Visual Effects, making it the
  first film to receive this honor for CGI-produced effects.
