  and sweet dishes over the years. But his enterprise only started getting deserved
  recognition and respect when Mr. Mittal worked on his vision to bring back to Punjab
  the long lost, shining glory of Takshila. He found X in 2005 that bears testimony
  to his tireless efforts, indomitable will, and strong sense of commitment to his
  ideals and goals?
