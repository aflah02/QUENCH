question: The word X was coined by American humorist Gelett Burgess. His short 1906
  book "Are You a Bromide?" was presented in a limited edition with a dust jacket.
  The jacket proclaimed "YES, this is a 'X'!" with a picture of a (fictitious) young
  woman "Miss Belinda X" shown calling out, described as "in the act of Xing." The
  name and term stuck for any publisher's contents on a book's back cover, even after
  the picture was dropped and only the text remained.
