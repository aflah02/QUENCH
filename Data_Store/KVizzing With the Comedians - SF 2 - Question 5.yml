question: "In 1982, a group of 150 Icelanders visited the NATO base in Keflavik in\
  \ search of \"endangered X\" who they believed were at risk from American Phantom\
  \ jets and AWACS reconnaissance planes. They felt that the military's presence disrespected\
  \ their beliefs and desecrated sacred land. In 2013, plans for a road construction\
  \ project from \xC4lftanes peninsula to the Reykjavik suburb of Gar\xF6ab\xE6r were\
  \ halted due to protests from X supporters and environmental groups. They argued\
  \ that the road would harm the habitat of X. The Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration\
  \ has even prepared a comprehensive five-page document about X emphasizing the importance\
  \ of respecting cultural heritage. In some cases, construction projects have been\
  \ delayed to allow the X to supposedly relocate, demonstrating a response to these\
  \ concerns."
