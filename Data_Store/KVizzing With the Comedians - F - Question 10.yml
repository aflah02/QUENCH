question: First appearing around the early 1930s as a noun, X referred to an item
  at a soda fountain, or lunch counter, that had been sold out. In the 1950s the word
  began to be used as a verb meaning "to refuse to serve a customer," and later took
  on the slightly extended meaning of "to get rid of; to throw out." The word was
  especially used in reference to refusing further bar service to inebriates. The
  etymology of X is unclear but the most common explanation is that the word came
  about as rhyming slang for nix. Eventually the use of X broadened further to include
  the meaning "shut out," or "rejected" or "to kill." The cover art for Eagles' 1980
  live album Eagles Live features a stenciled version of X.
