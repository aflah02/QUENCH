question: During the making of the blockbuster movie, filmmaker Rohit Shetty expressed
  initial displeasure with a particular line in a song (X), prompting a discussion
  with the rapper involved. Rohit Shetty disclosed in an interview that the song was
  a last-minute addition to the film. According to Shetty, he had reservations about
  a specific word in the song, considering the young audience of his films. However,

  to accommodate the family-friendly tone. Despite the change, the rapper humorously
  remarked, "'Isse zyada main shareef nahi ho sakta aapke liye,'" highlighting his
  playfulness. Eventually, the song became a massive hit, leaving fans enthralled.
