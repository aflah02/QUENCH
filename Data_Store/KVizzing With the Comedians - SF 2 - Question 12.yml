question: The word (X) was imported from Japan in the late 1850s, and its original
  meaning had very little to do with business. X was the title of the shogun, Japan's
  hereditary military dictator. Its literal meaning is "Great Lord/Prince" or "Supreme
  Commander". The word quickly took on an extended meaning, and by the early 1860s
  was being used to refer to a noteworthy or important person. Now it is usually used
  to refer to "a person of great wealth, influence or power".
