question: Originating from an imaginative moment, this automotive symbol (X) traces
  its roots back to a French hotel where one of its co- founders, William C. Durant,
  found inspiration in a pattern on wallpaper. However, the story takes a twist when
  Durant's widow mentioned a different setting altogether, a holiday in Hot Springs,
  Virginia. The motif resembling a slanted bowtie, possibly borrowed from an advertisement
  by the Southern Compressed Coal Company, found its place in history as the emblem
  for a pioneering automobile brand. Born from the creative minds behind a company
  founded in 1911, this symbol has evolved over the years, transitioning from a blue
  design to the iconic gold emblem seen on cars and trucks worldwide.
