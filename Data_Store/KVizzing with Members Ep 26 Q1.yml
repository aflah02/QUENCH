question: Sportsperson X, driven by a strong desire for orderliness, developed a fascination
  for Archery, prompting her to join an archery center. However, upon her arrival,
  there was no archery training scheduled for that day. In the absence of archery
  activities, she stumbled upon footage of the iconic sportsperson Kunjarani Devi
  from a distinct discipline. This encounter proved to be so motivating that X abandoned
  her initial interest in Archery and chose to pursue the sport associated with Kunjarani
  Devi instead.
