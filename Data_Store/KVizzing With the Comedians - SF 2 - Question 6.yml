question: A Norman X, named after design expert Don Norman, refers to a X that is
  unclear and confusing in its usability. These often display visual cues that lead
  users to make incorrect assumptions about how to operate them, requiring additional
  signage for clarification. It can be frustrating for individuals who encounter these
  as they need to rely on trial and error or observation of others to determine whether
  to do one thing or the other the X, resulting in awkward situations. Ideally, a
  well-designed X should be intuitive and require no second-guessing from users. It
  should eliminate the need for signage and effortlessly guide individuals on how
  to operate it correctly.
