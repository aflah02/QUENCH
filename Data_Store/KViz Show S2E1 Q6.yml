question: '"X" is a quotation attributed to American politician and orator Patrick
  Henry from a speech he made to the Second Virginia Convention on March 23, 1775:
  "If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest.
  There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their
  clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston! The war is inevitable and let it
  come! I repeat it, sir, let it come. It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.
  Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace but there is no peace. The war is actually begun!
  The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding
  arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it
  that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as
  to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know
  not what course others may take; but as for me, X"'
