  X: The phenomenon, Brownian motion, is named after the botanist Robert Brown, who
    first described it in 1827 while looking through a microscope at the pollen of
    the plant Clarkia pulchella immersed in water. Then, in 1905, theoretical physicist
    Albert Einstein published a paper where he modeled the motion of the pollen particles
    as being moved by individual water molecules, making one of his first major scientific
    contributions. Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services
    to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
    effect."
