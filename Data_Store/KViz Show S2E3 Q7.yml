question: X's origin wasn't in the industry we know it from, and it initially bore
  the name Y. Founded in 1926 by Sakichi Y, the company, known as Y Automatic Loom
  Works, specialized in manufacturing looms. In 1933, Sakichi's son, Kiichiro, established
  a separate division, paving the way for the company's venture into the sector. The
  transition from "Y" to "X" occurred in 1936 during a competition to design a new
  logo. The winning design retained the three Japanese characters representing the
  Y name. However, after careful consideration, the Y family opted for the modified
  "X." The change was motivated by the fact that writing "Y" required nine brush strokes,
  while "X" needed only eight, a fortunate number in Japanese culture. Additionally,
  the altered name was deemed more appealing, leading to the evolution from Y to X.
