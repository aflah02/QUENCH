question: Madagascar is the largest producer of vanilla in the world. In 1985, the
  economy of Madagascar nearly crashed. This is because a certain company (X) introduced
  a new variant of its product. This new variant (Y) used vanillin, a less expensive
  synthetic substitute, whereas the original product, which uses natural vanilla,
  was discontinued. This resulted in purchases of vanilla dropping significantly during
  this period. Madagascar's economy stabilised only after the new variant flopped
  and the company discontinued it.
