question: X and Y's origins changed because of a rights issue. In the comic books,
  X and Y aid Magneto in his villainy, but with the X-Men split off from other Marvel
  entities due to movie studios rights, the production team behind this 2015 movie
  gave X and Y a different origin story. With no Magneto in the universe, X and Y
  are test subjects for Hydra's Baron Wolfgang von Strucker.
