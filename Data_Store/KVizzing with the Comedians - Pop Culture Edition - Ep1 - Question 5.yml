question: X pays tribute to queer history and culture. A great example of this is
  when a queen gets eliminated from the show and leaves a farewell message in red
  lipstick on the mirror. This is a reference to the film Butterfield 8, starring
  the original gay icon Elizabeth Taylor. In what is considered an iconic scene, Taylor
  scrawls a message on the mirror saying "No sale" when a lover leaves money for her.
  It had a humble beginning on Logo TV and went on to win 19 Emmy Awards (and counting)
