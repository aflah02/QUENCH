question: One possible origin of the term, in the sense of a period of entertainment,
  is from the US Navy. In early 1913, a group of homemakers called the "X Y Social"
  organized "semi- weekly smokers" on board IJSS Arkansas. This soon started being
  referred to as 'X Y'. The events included a variety of entertainment, like boxing
  and wrestling matches, music, dancing, and movies. By the end of World War l, the
  practice had spread throughout the Navy. During the Prohibition era, people would
  host "X Y", at illicit bars before eating at restaurants where alcohol could not
  be served.
