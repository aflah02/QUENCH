question: Considered one of North America's oldest sports, X traces its origins to
  a time predating the arrival of European settlers in Canada. Indigenous peoples,
  known as First Nations, engaged in a variation of the sport, commonly called "baggatawa,"
  "tewaarathon," or "stickball." According to the Federation of International X, Algonquin
  First Nations in the St. Lawrence Valley initiated the game in the 1630s, with subsequent
  spread. A pivotal moment occurred in 1834 when Caughnawaga First Nations demonstrated
  the sport in Montreal, leading to further development. Dr. William George Beers,
  founding the Montreal X Club, formalized the game's rules. By 1860, X gained recognition
  as Canada's National Game (unofficially), and it made its Olympic debut in the 1904
  Games in St. Louis.
