question: The "X" (2 Words) is used as a metaphor for a seemingly intractable problem
  which is solved by exercising an unexpectedly direct, novel, rule-bending, decisive
  and simple approach to the problem that removes the perceived constraints. According
  to ancient Greek legends, this was to be untied only by the future conqueror of
  Asia. In popular accounts, Y sliced through it with his sword, exercising a form
  of mental genius. The phrase "cutting the X" has thus come to denote a bold solution
  to a complicated problem.
