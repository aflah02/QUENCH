question: During 218 BC, Hannibal and his army, having passed through Spain en route
  to his intended conquest of Rome, decided to rest for a while at a place known as
  Les Bouillens. A certain St John Harmsworth bought the place at around 1900 and
  renamed the place after the previous owner. He started manufacturing X at the place
  with the packaging inspired from Indian clubs which Harmsworth used for exercise.

variable_specific_rationale:
  X: Hannibal and his army acts as a clue as they rested there and consumed the water
    which they really liked. Indian clubs have a very similar shape to Perrier's water
    bottles. Hence we can narrow it down to Perrier.
