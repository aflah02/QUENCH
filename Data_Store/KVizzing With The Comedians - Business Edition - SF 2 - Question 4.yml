question: X-Y is a board game made by San Francisco State University Professor Ralph
  Anspach. Anspach created this in part as a response to the lessons taught by the
  mainstream game Y, which he believed created the impression that these were something
  desirable. His intent was to show how X-trust laws work to curtail Ys in the real
  world. The game was originally to be produced in 1973 as Bust the Trust, but the
  title was changed to X-Y. It has seen multiple printings and revisions since 1973.
  The game is currently still in print, and is produced and distributed worldwide
  by University Games.
