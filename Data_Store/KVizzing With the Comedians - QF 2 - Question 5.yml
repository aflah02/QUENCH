question: It (X) started quietly and privately, and compared with the fame it would
  attract over the next 50 years, understatedly. In an unassuming Adelaide home in
  mid-1971, a piece of Australian history was being assiduously created. But as Sandy
  Hanson sat at the sewing machine of her Hyde Park townhouse over several of those
  winter nights, she had no idea this thing she was stitching as a favour for a friend
  would become one of the nation's most recognised symbols. On July 12, 1971, armed
  with Sandy Hanson's finished work, it was carried down King William Street through
  the city's centre, where, at a rally near the fountains at Victoria Square, this
  recognised symbol was first used publicly.
