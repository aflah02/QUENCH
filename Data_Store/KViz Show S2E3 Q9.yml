question: Sweethearts, the confectionary brand, released a special limited edition
  of sweeties for Valentine's Day. In a nod to Gen Z's dating landscape, these special
  boxes are designed for those who relish the beauty of untraditional connections.
  Instead of the classic "Be Mine" or "Forever," the messages on these heart-shaped
  treats are intentionally misprinted and blurry, offering sweet, muddled nothings
  and literal mixed messages. Term X encapsulates these nuanced connections celebrated
  by Sweethearts this Valentine's Day
