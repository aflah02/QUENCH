question: Nearly every sword-wielding fantasy hero from the 20th century owes a tribute
  to Robert E. Howard's X. Set in the fictional Hyborian Age, after the destruction
  of Atlantis but before our general recorded history, X's stories have depicted him
  as everything from a cunning thief to a noble king and all types of scoundrel in
  between. But beneath that blood-soaked sword and shield is a character that struck
  a nerve with generations of fantasy fans, spawning adaptations in comics, video
  games, movies, TV shows, and cartoons in the eight decades since he first appeared
  in the December 1932 issue of Weird Tales.
