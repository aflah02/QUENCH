question: One of the most iconic scenes in The Godfather (1972) was the death of Sonny
  Corleone. The character, played by James Caan, gets ambushed at a toll booth by
  Barzini's men, who shower him with a rain of bullets. It was inspired by another
  crime-themed movie (X) released five years ago that is considered groundbreaking
  in its portrayal of on-screen violence. X is based on real-life American criminals.
