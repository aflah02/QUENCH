variable_specific_rationale:
  X: The Capriati Rule, named after former no. 1 player Jennifer Capriati, was enacted
    by the WTA in 1995 to limit the number of tournaments that players between the
    ages of 14 and 17 could enter, due to concerns about the physical and emotional
    toll of professional tennis on young players. The rule aimed to protect the health
    and well-being of teenage players, such as Capriati herself, who experienced early
    success but eventually burned out.
  Y: Jennifer Capriati is a former American professional tennis player who won the
    gold medal at the 1992 Olympics and rose to the no. 1 ranking in the early 1990s.
    However, she struggled with the physical and emotional demands of professional
    tennis at a young age, leading to burnout and a decline in her career. The WTA's
    age-eligibility rules, known as the Capriati Rule, were named after her in recognition
    of her early success and the challenges she faced as a young player.
