question: 'X''s rivalry with fellow existentialist of occupied France Y is well known.
  When X was 24 and writing for journals and periodicals, he read the novel Nausea
  by Y, praising the author''s "limitless gifts." But X, in true "you missed a spot"
  fashion, took the space to assert his own vision of art against Y''s, who created
  a book in which "remarkable fictional gifts and the play of the toughest and the
  most lucid mind are both lavished and squandered." Y would hit back at the young
  and audacious writer, reviewing his Myth of Sisyphus with the remark: "X has the
  affectation of quoting the works of Jaspers, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, without, however,
  fully understanding them."'
