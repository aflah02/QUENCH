question: Despite extensive investigations by the FBI, the true identity and fate
  of X remains unknown. The case has captured public fascination and has become one
  of the most famous unsolved mysteries in American history. Numerous theories and
  speculations have emerged over the years, but none have been proven definitively.
  The FBI officially closed the case in 2016, stating that no credible leads had been
  developed in recent years. In 2021, the incident also found its way into pop culture.
  The TV series Y offered its own take on the story revealing that Y assumed the identity
  of X and orchestrated the entire event. Y managed to deceive the authorities by
  mysteriously disappearing mid-air, never to be discovered again.
