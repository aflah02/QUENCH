question: A famous quotation (X) from baseball player and manager Yogi Berra. Berra
  used it in 1973, while managing the New York Mets, to mean a team is not out of
  the pennant race until they are mathematically eliminated. In sports, it is usually
  used to mean that a game is not officially over until time expires or the final
  out is registered, and that the players need to stay mentally focused until that
  point, particularly when their team has a large lead but there is sufficient time
  for the opposing team to come back and win.
