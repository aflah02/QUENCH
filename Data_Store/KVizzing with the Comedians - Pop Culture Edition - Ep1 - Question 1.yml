question: "There is a myth that Walt Disney's last words were \"X\" (A Name). Nope.\
  \ The actor's name was one of the last things he wrote in his office, but the note\
  \ is undated\u2014it could have been up to a month old at the time Walt died in\
  \ a hospital. X has a connection with Disney, though: He has appeared in a Disney-\
  \ produced or -distributed film every decade since the 1960s, including 1969's The\
  \ Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, 1971's The Barefoot Executive, 1981's The Fox and\
  \ the Hound, 1993's Tombstone(which was distributed by Disney), and 2005's Sky High.\
  \ Disney also owns Marvel, so 2017's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 should count,\
  \ right?"
