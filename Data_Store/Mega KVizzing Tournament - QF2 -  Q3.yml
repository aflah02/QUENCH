question: The intriguing classmate (X) in this vibrant comic strip world, distinguished
  by having both a first and last name, is a character known for her studious and
  polite nature. While residing on the same street as the main character, she occasionally
  exhibits a mischievous side when provoked. Engaging in activities like hosting tea
  parties, playing house with stuffed animals, and participating in imaginative games
  where she takes on roles such as a high-powered lawyer or politician, she stands
  out from other characters in the strip. Despite moments of tension, including disrupting
  cheating attempts and retaliating against attacks with snowballs or water balloons,
  there is a popular belief that hidden feelings may be present beneath her composed
  exterior.
