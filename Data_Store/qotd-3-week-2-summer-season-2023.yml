question: Silicon based life is a possibility that scientists have been discussing
  for quite a while now. Like carbon, silicon too is tetravalent and can create molecules
  that are sufficiently large enough to carry biological information. While there
  is no proof for the same yet, a sci-fi tv show portrayed a sentient silicon based
  life form that ate rocks and lived on another planet. There have been over 125 games
  related to the franchise, with the first one being created on BASIC.

variable_specific_rationale:
  TV Show: This description matches the concept of the Horta, a silicon-based life
    form that appears in the Star Trek franchise. The Horta is a sentient, rock-like
    creature that lives on the planet Janus VI and is capable of communication with
    humans. The first Star Trek series, The Original Series, aired in the 1960s and
    was created by Gene Roddenberry. Since then, there have been numerous spin-offs,
    movies, and games related to the franchise, with over 125 games being developed.
    The mention of the first game being created on BASIC refers to the fact that the
    first Star Trek game, titled "Star Trek," was developed in 1971 by Mike Mayfield
    and was written in BASIC. The game was a text-based adventure game that allowed
    players to explore the galaxy and interact with various alien species, including
    the Horta.
