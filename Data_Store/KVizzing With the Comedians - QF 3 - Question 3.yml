question: X's first album was released in 1996 and stayed on the MTV Asia Charts for
  60 weeks. All the lyrics were written by his childhood friend Syed Aslam Noor. After
  many record labels rejected the album as the genre was not popular at that time,
  X went to Amitabh Bachchan Corporation, where the songs were unused for about 6
  months. Then he went to BMG Crescendo which agreed to release the album but asked
  the singer to make the music video, which led him to another childhood friend Mahesh
  Mathai, who directed the iconic video in an ancient African site.
