question: The term X was coined by Neil deGrasse Tyson, a native New Yorker and renowned
  astrophysicist. As a teenager, Tyson visited the iconic Stonehenge monument and
  was inspired by the alignment of the solstice rays at its center. This experience
  sparked his imagination, leading him to draw a comparison between the sun's perfect
  setting between the high-rises of a city and the captivating alignment observed
  at Stonehenge. In this city specifically, the event takes place around the months
  of May and July, typically for two nights on each occasion. It occurs approximately
  three weeks before and three weeks after the summer solstice, marking the longest
  day of the year.
