question: 'According to a 2018 study by Occupational Safety and Health Administration
  (OSHA), US X workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury compared
  to the average American worker. There are an average of 17 "severe" incidents per
  month in US X plants, involving hospitalizations, amputations, or loss of an eye.
  Amputations occur twice a week on average. The picture is similar in the I-JK. Factors
  contributing to high injury rate include: High-speed lines, Dangerous working conditions,
  Lack of training, Pressure to meet production quotas Other studies show that in
  addition to the physical injuries, workers are also exposed to the possibility of
  emotional injury, experiencing psychological harm as a result of the work process.'
