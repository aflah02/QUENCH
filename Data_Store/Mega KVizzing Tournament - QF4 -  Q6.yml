question: X Theory is an idea in political science. It asserts that the far-right
  is more similar to the far-left than to the center- right and vice versa. X Theory
  is often used as argument for centrism. People who believe in the X theory argue
  that the Far-left and the Far-right are closer to each other than either is to the
  centrists. The name X Theory comes from the idea that politics is not a straight
  line from left to right but bent like a X so that the two ends (the far-left and
  the far-right) share more similarities with each other than their moderate counterparts.
