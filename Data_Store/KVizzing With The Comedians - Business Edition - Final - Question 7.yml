question: The term X was coined by New York environmentalist Jay Westerveld in a 1986
  essay about the hotel industry's practice of placing notices in bedrooms promoting
  reuse of towels to "save the environment". He noted that often little or no effort
  toward reducing energy waste was made by these institutions, although towel reuse
  saved them laundry costs. He labeled this and other profitable-but-ineffective "environmentally-
  conscientious" acts as X. What term that is a form of advertising aimed at projecting
  an environment friendly image?
