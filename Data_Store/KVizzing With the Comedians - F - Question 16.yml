question: Tim wanted to use the name of the lowest tier of Hot Hells (Naraka) in Buddhism
  to be his stage name. However, he couldn't use it as there was already a Myspace
  account with that name. So he added an extra 'i' at the end and began using X as
  his stage name. On 8 September 2021, Google released a doodle to pay homage to Tim
  on what would have been his 32nd birthday during National Suicide Prevention Week.
  Interestingly, X was also the codename of OnePlus Nord, a smartphone released in
  2020.
