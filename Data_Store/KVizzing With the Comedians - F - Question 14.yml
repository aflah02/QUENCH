question: In the 1928 edition of the Oxford English Dictionary(OED), X held the record
  for the entry with most meanings. The print edition of the OED still encompasses
  around 200 definitions for the word X. However, the editors of the OED recently
  disclosed that in the third edition (which will be completed in 2037), "Run" has
  now surpassed X and has become the English word with the most potential meanings.
  According to British author Simon Winchester, this shift reflects the dynamic and
  fast-paced nature of our modern era, rendering words like X as dull and passive
  in comparison. Interestingly, X is also a 3 letter word.
