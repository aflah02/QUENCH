question: Some of the biggest and influential products of Info Edge are- * X.com *
  Jeevansathi.com * 99acres.com * Shiksha.com While the public are quite familiar
  with each of these products but it is less likely that the parent company is equally
  popular among masses. That was quite probably one of the reasons why when Info Edge
  went public in 2006, it used the name X.
