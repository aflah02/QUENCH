question: It's hard to imagine what the show Y might look like if it were stripped
  of all its chaotic characters and performed as a solo show, but that's exactly how
  it started. Before there was a TV show, creator/star X staged Y as a one- woman
  play at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival back in 2013. The title character addressed
  the audience in an hour-long, sexcapade-filled monologue, which was generally met
  with praise by theater critics. The TV show was created soon after, and originally
  premiered on July 2016.
