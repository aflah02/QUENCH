question: Hidden within the realm of document customization in LaTeX, a peculiar package
  (X) adds a touch of spontaneity to an otherwise formal environment. Crafted by Hanno
  Rein and diligently maintained by Patrick Bideault, this package fills a void that
  has lingered for far too long in the LaTeX world. You can choose from 4 options,
  such as a 270 degree circular imprint with two tiny adornments, a 60 degree circular
  mark, a pair of delicate hues dancing across the page and a vibrant twin manifestation.
  This is a unique feature that allow you to effortlessly grace your documents without
  the need for manual intervention
