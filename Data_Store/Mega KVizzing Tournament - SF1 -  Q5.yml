question: In a unique culinary event hosted by former White House chef Sam Kass, a
  new concept was brought to life, not as a feast of obscure foods but as a warning
  about the potential impact of climate change on our daily meals. The dinner featured
  dishes like Norwegian salmon, oysters, Iamb, fingerling potatoes. These seemingly
  ordinary items are at risk of drastic change or disappearance due to climate warming.
  The dinner aims not only to raise awareness about the immediate threats to our food
  supply but also to inspire action. X is a thought-provoking 3-word title that was
  given to this event (alluding to a famous reference), symbolizing the potential
  loss of cherished foods and the need for climate-conscious choices in our daily
  lives
