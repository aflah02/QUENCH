question: The first known use of the word X for beer, in a document dated 1677, referred
  to its strength. The name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown
  beer. The stronger beers, typically 7% or 8% alcohol by volume (ABV), were called
  "X porters". Now, however, the term X has become firmly associated with dark beer,
  rather than just strong beer.
