question: Over nearly 9 years, Hannah and Lauren Luckey cultivated a daily ritual
  that began casually and evolved into an indispensable routine. This digital interaction
  (X), more than a mere habit, became a lifeline for their friendship, offering tangible
  proof that someone special was in each other's thoughts daily. This unique connection
  transcended distance, providing comfort and companionship amid life's challenges.
  Despite time differences and long-distance hurdles, they discovered an ideal medium
  to maintain this ritual, as traditional methods proved impractical. Through this,
  they shared the intimate aspects of their lives, fostering a lasting sense of closeness
  even during moments of silence. X is an enduring activity, marked by an unbroken
  chain of daily interactions and shared moments, and is at the heart of this lasting
  and meaningful connection
