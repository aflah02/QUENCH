question: It is believed in the fall of 1982, X got a phone call from his friend and
  science fiction writer, Arthur C. Clarke, after Clarke watched the film E.T. by
  Steven Spielberg. Watching the film, Clarke was struck by the similarities between
  E.T. and 'The Alien,' a script by X written in 1967. In that script, an alien landed
  in a village and befriended a young boy. Some people till today want to believe
  that E.T. was a plagiarised story from 'The Alien'.
