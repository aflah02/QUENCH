question: In 2004 Monaco GP, Jaguar Formula 1 team raced with diamonds embedded in
  the nose cones of their cars as part of a promotion for the film X. However, on
  the opening lap of the Monaco Grand Prix, Christian Klien crashed his car and the
  diamond from his nose cone went missing. There are a few theories about what happened
  to the diamond. Some believe that it was lost in the crash, while others believe
  that it was stolen. There is also a theory that the diamond was never real to begin
  with and was just a publicity stunt. But the mystery of the missing diamond has
  never been solved.
