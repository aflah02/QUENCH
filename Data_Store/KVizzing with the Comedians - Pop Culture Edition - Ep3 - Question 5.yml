question: The character of Vincent Vega in the movie X was written for Michael Madsen.
  The director Y specifically wrote a number of roles in the film for chosen actors
  (including Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Amanda Plummer), but
  nothing compared to his dedication to having Michael Madsen play Vincent. Madsen,
  who knew of Y's plans and said he wanted to do the part, dropped out two weeks before
  the script was finished to star in a movie called Wyatt Earp.

  X: Pulp Fiction had a special role written for Michael Madsen by Quentin Tarantino.

    and Amanda Plummer feature in Pulp Fiction.
  Y: Quentin Tarantino directed Pulp Fiction which has many famous characters such
    as Samuel L. Jackson, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Amanda Plummer. Michael Madsen

    mind however he backed off at the last moment.
