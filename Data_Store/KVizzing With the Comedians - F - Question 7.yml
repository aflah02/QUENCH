question: X was a close friend of Beatles guitarist George Harrison and the two are
  said to have contributed to each other's work. However, X fell in love with model
  Pattie Boyd, who had married Harrison in 1966. X's friend Ian Dallas, who had converted
  to Islam and taken the name Shaykh Abdalqadir, gave X a book by the Persian writer
  Nizami. It tells an ancient story about a poet who falls in mad love with a beautiful
  girl whom he is forbidden to marry. The story struck a deep chord with X, who got
  inspired to write a song about it, Y, titled after one of the protagonists of the
  love story.
