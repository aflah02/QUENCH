question: X is one of the biggest fashion trends of 2023 and also one of the hardest
  to describe. It's one of those "you'll know it when you see it" trends and is 100%
  logo-less. It is often used to describe high-end products or services that are designed
  to be elegant and luxurious without being ostentatious or showy. It is seen in the
  hit HBO series "Succession," where characters regularly wear $600 cashmere baseball
  caps in neutral colors, sans logos and subtle or the very recent Gwyneth Paltrow
  and her head-to-toe Prada, luxurious cashmere sweaters and Celine boots during her
  week in a Utah courtroom in a dispute over a ski crash. Loro Piana, Brunello Cucinelli,
  Hermes and Armani are some brands that have been associated with this for nearly
  two decades.
