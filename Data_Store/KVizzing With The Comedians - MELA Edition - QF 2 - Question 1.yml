question: Eminem's 2013 music video for the song "Rap God" features imagery from Dante's
  Purgatorio, including the illustration of X. This is most likely a metaphor for
  the rappers who try to compete with the self-proclaimed "Rap God," just like X tried
  to compete with Athena in a weaving contest but was turned into the first spider
  instead.

variable_specific_rationale:
  X: The music video for Eminem's song "Rap God" features an illustration of Arachne's
    Punishment. Arachne was a mortal who challenged Athena, the goddess, to a weaving
    contest and lost. When Athena could find no flaws in the tapestry Arachne had
    woven for the contest, the goddess became enraged and beat the girl with her shuttle.
    After Arachne hanged herself out of shame, she was transformed into a spider.
    The myth both provides an aetiology of spiders' web-spinning abilities and was
    a cautionary tale about hubris.
