question: "While the First World War involved a lot of futile activity, fighting at\
  \ night was especially unproductive because there was no way to see where you were\
  \ shooting. Night combat was made somewhat easier by the British invention of X\
  \ Ys\u2014rounds which emitted small amounts of flammable material that left a phosphorescent\
  \ trail. The first attempt, in 1915, wasn't actually that useful, as the trail was\
  \ \"erratic\" and limited to 100 meters, but the second X model developed in 1916,\
  \ the .303 SPG Mark VIIG, emitted a regular bright green- white trail and was a\
  \ real hit. Its popularity was due in part to an unexpected side-benefit: the flammable\
  \ agent could ignite hydrogen, which made it perfect for \"balloon-busting\" the\
  \ German zeppelins then terrorizing England."
