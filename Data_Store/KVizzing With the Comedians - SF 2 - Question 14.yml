question: There once was a woman who had 100 children. She named each of them after
  numbers in the order they were born. There was a fire and all of them died except
  Ninety. Ninety went off to have kids of her own. They were very kind and loving.
  One day they found an injured dog. They took it home and nursed it back to health.
  They hid the dog and never told their mother, afraid she would kick the dog out.
  In fact they never told anyone. To keep from arousing any suspicions they named
  the dog "This" so the name could be used in conversation. One day This ran away.
  They never saw This again. No one else knew about This. No one even knew a dog named
  This existed. What is the final sentence of this story (X), used widely on the internet
  in a certain context?
