question: The Egg and Wine Diet is a fad diet that was popularized in 1964 and revived
  in 2018 on social media platforms. The diet has experienced a viral resurgence and
  turned heads not because of its health benefits or results, but because of its ridiculous
  parameters. The diet advocates the consumption of 3-5 eggs per day plus a bottle
  of wine. In 1977 this diet was published in a magazine that made it so popular that
  it is also known as the X Egg and Wine Diet. X is an American monthly fashion and
  lifestyle magazine. It was first published in 1892 as a weekly newspaper that slowly
  turned into an iconic fashion magazine.
