question: Surprisingly, the word X is not etymologically related to the two words
  it is made up of. Instead, it has an entirely different root. The word stems from
  the Late Latin word that means 'beyond' and thus, X is an act that is beyond what
  is considered acceptable. A noun and a verb, X is triggered by a serious offence
  which causes an intense reaction of indignation, disbelief, and anger.

variable_specific_rationale:
  X: "\u201COutrage\u201D derives from the Latin word ultraticum, which meant \u201C\
    excessive.\u201D The root is ultra, which in Latin means \u201Cbeyond\u201D or\
    \ \u201Cextremely,\u201D just like it does in English. Ultra shares a Proto-Indo-European\
    \ root with the English word \u201Cother,\u201D but not with the word \u201Cout.\u201D\
    \ When the Latin word ultraticum entered Old French, it became oltrage, and then\
    \ evolved into outrage."
