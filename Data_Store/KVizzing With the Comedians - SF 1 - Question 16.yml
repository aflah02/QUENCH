question: X, a city name, is the evolved Spanish form of the native place name which
  comes from a local phrase meaning "where indigo is found". A part of the name is
  derived from the Sanskrit word Ineel' which refers to indigo. Indigo dye extraction
  became an important economic activity in this area in the 18th century. Another
  theory suggests that the city was named after the Nilad plant that used to be very
  common in the area. A popular piece of stationery shares its name with this city.
