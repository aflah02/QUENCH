question: Acherontia atropos, the African death's-head hawkmoth, gets its name from
  the sinister-looking skull shape on its back. In many cultures, it is thought to
  be an omen of death. A death's-head hawkmoth will squeak when a hungry predator
  approaches and the noise often deters them. This has appeared in a movie (X) from
  the 1990s.

  X: The poster of The Silence of the Lambs features this species of hawk moth. In
    spite of the fact that this hawk moth is perfectly harmless except as a minor
    pest to crops and to beehives, the fancied skull pattern has burdened the moth
    with a negative reputation, such as associations with the supernatural and evil.
    There are numerous superstitions to the effect that the moth brings bad luck to
    the house into which it flies and that death or misfortune may be expected to
    follow.
