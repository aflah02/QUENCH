question: X is the second longest Z in the world and got its name by Sir Mountstuart
  Elphinstone Grant Duff, the Governor of Y in the year 1881. Before this, it was
  just a big strip of sand. When he visited X, he fell in love with what he saw, and
  ordered that a promenade be immediately constructed. Since then, many significant
  buildings, statues, and other attractions have been added to the promenade. Recently
  the government of the state proposed a statue of a pen- shaped monument within X
  to mark the literary contributions of the state's ex-CM.
