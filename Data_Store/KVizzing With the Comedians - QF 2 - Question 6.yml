question: A X is a type of Chinese dumpling commonly found across regional styles
  of Chinese cuisine. Yang Xiong from the western Han Dynasty mentioned "bing wei
  zhi tun," which means X are a type of bread. The difference is that X have fillings
  inside and are eaten after being steamed or boiled. The Ancient Chinese thought
  they were a sealed bun, lacking "qi qiao" ('seven orifices'). So it was called "hun
  dun" which means 'turbidity' or 'chaos.' From the time of the Tang dynasty, people
  began to differentiate the names of dumplings and X.
