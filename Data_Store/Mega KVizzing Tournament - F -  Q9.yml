question: The idea for X stemmed from the negative reception of Scott Cawthon's previous
  game, the family-friendly Chipper & Sons Lumber Co. Players said that the main character
  (a young beaver) looked like "a scary animatronic animal" and reviewer James Sterling
  called the game "unintentionally terrifying". Initially discouraged by the criticism,
  Cawthon (who had previously primarily developed Christian-oriented games) eventually
  used the feedback to make something intentionally scarier. A video game series got
  created after that, which also inspired a 2023 movie of the same name which garnered
  negative reviews from critics but was a commercial success.
