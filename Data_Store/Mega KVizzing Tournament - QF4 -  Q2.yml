question: In a hypothetical scenario discussed by a Reddit user, Major League Baseball
  teams consider rebranding with names inspired by the most abundantly populated animal
  in their regions. The AL East sees Tampa Bay, Boston, New York, Toronto, and Baltimore
  adopting this approach, as does the AL Central with Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit,
  Kansas City, and Minnesota. The AL West teams, including Houston, Seattle, Oakland,
  Los Angeles of Anaheim, and Texas, follow suit. The NL East, NL Central, and NL
  West undergo similar transformations, exploring new identities based on the most
  populous creatures in each region. X could be the most dominant animal mascot in
  this imaginative takeover.
