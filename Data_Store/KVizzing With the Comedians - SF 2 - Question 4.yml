question: X's first and only major press conference was held in Killinochchi in 2002
  in which he was introduced as the "President and Prime Minister of Y." Repeated
  questions about his involvement in a certain event were only answered in a sober
  note by him, calling it a "tragic incident" ("Thunbiyal Chambavam", as quoted in
  Tamil) and requesting the press "not to dig into an incident that happened 10 years
  ago." Among other titles, he was called "Karikalan" for his bravery and his administration
  (in reference to Karikala Chola, a famous Chola king).
