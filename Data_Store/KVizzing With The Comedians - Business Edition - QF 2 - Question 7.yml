question: X began publication as a tabloid-size weekly newspaper catering to women
  in the middle and upper classes. It showcased fashion from Germany and Paris in
  a newspaper-design format. In fact, it was directly inspired by and modeled on a
  German fashion magazine Der Y, and received content from the German magazine in
  its early years, often publishing it simultaneously. It was not until 1901 that
