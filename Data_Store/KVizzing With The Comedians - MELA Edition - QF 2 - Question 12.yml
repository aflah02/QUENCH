question: X is a term for a user's response to an interface where there is insufficient
  differentiation between active, 'clickable' elements, and content. Without appropriate
  visual cues, the user must 'scrub' the screen to 'unearth' active elements. It is
  named after a 1960s single-player video game which most of us have played.

  X: Minesweeping originally refers to the game Minesweeper, which originated in the
    1960s when it used to be played on mainframe computers. It is also referred to
    as the activity of moving the pointer across icons to uncover ToolTips or rollovers
    in order to figure out what the icons represent. Such designs require the user
    to actively decipher the interface, probing and testing the meaning of each interface
    element rather than the interface elements being self-apparent.
