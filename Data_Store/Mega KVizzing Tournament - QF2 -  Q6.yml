question: 'Upon author X''s death in 1928, it was deemed fitting to bury him at Westminster
  Abbey due to his literary success. Despite this, X''s strong connection to Dorset
  led him to express a desire for burial in the small Stinsford church graveyard,
  a place he cherished since childhood. A compromise was reached: X''s body was interred
  at Westminster Abbey, while his heart was to be buried in Dorset as per his wish.
  The village doctor delicately removed the heart, placing it on a table wrapped in
  cloth. Upon the doctor''s return, he found the heart missing, consumed by a cat.
  Consequently, the doctor euthanized the cat, burying it, and photos of X''s heart
  funeral reveal a container seemingly too large for a heart but just right for a
  cat.'
