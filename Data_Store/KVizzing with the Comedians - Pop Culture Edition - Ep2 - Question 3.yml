  \ motifs and argued that myths from around the world that have been passed down\
  \ through generations\u2014like Beowulf or King Arthur\u2014share a basic structure.\
  \ According to Campbell, \"A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into\
  \ a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive\
  \ victory is won; the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power\
  \ to bestow boons on his fellow man.\""
