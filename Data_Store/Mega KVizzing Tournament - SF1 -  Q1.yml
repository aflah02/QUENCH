question: X comes from a Hindi and Telugu word meaning "day-laborer", which is associated
  with an Urdu word meaning "slave". The word X was first used in the 16th century
  by European traders across Asia. By the 18th century, the term referred to migrant
  Indian indentured labourers. In the 19th century the term was adopted for the transportation
  and employment of Asian labourers via employment contracts on sugar plantations
  formerly worked by enslaved Africans. The Chinese word X literally translates to
  "bitter strength" but is more commonly understood as "hard labour". The phrase 'brown
  X' is a term used for an Indian citizen who is posturing as a representative to
  a foreign institute.
