question: This injury, also known as Hutchinson fracture, was first identified in
  the late 19th century among professionals who encountered it while performing a
  specific task related to their job. The mechanism of injury was linked to an unconventional
  practice during that era when, while hand- cranking to start a certain machinery,
  an unexpected incident occurred. This sudden jerk could hyperextend the wrist, causing
  the fracture name. Although the naming may seem disconnected from its origin, today,
  these fractures are more commonly associated with different causes like falling
  on outstretched arms. This specific fracture called X, shares its name with the
  professionals who once faced this injury during their job tasks
