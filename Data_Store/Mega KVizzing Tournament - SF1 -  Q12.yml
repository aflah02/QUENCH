question: After World War 11, leaders Stalin and Churchill met secretly to decide
  who gets what land after the war. Stalin wanted more land because he helped defeat
  Hitler. Churchill didn't like this, but he had to agree. They called this secret
  deal the 'percentages agreement.' Churchill, jokingly, gave it another name (X)
  and said his American allies would be shocked if they saw how crudely he had put
  it
