question: This instrument (X) belongs to the brass family and its name is a harmonious
  fusion of the Italian word for a particular musical instrument and a suffix denoting
  largeness. Unlike its brass counterparts, it doesn't rely on valves to alter pitch;
  instead, it employs a telescoping slide mechanism. Beyond music, a quirky linguistic
  connection can be found in the French language, where the word for "paperclip" is
  the same as the name of this resonant instrument.
