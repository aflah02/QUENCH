question: The 'X Y' was likely developed in Australia or New Zealand - or both - in
  the 1980s. (Both countries take credit.) It's possible it was a case of communal
  thinking, with coffee enthusiasts each working toward a similar end result. One
  possibly apocryphal story has a New Zealand barista apologizing to a customer after
  a cappuccino failed to foam up properly, leading to a "X Y" drink. The X Y subsequently
  made its way to the States in the early 2010s, and it's now a common sight on coffee
  menus. There's some debate whether larger chains can prepare a proper X Y, as some
  coffee purists advocate for a premium espresso bean that makes for a creamier texture
  and milk that's heated but not steamed. Australian actor Hugh Jackman, who operated
  cafes in downtown Manhattan in 2015, said that Starbucks offering a X Y was a "compliment"
  but suggested customers try a presumably more authentic version from his shop.
