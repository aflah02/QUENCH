question: In the Royal National Park near Bundeena, Sydney, there's a mesmerizing
  sandstone formation (X) suspended 25 meters above sea levels. Named for its uncanny
  resemblance to a specific celebratory dessert, this formation stands out with its
  perfectly cuboid shape and white appearance. Despite its charm, recent surveys indicate
  instability, and the landmark is predicted to collapse into the Tasman Sea within
  the next decade.
