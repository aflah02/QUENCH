question: X and Y are both similar sounding dishes from Indian cuisine that are sometimes
  confused with each other. X can be made with a variety of ingredients such as vegetables,
  meat, or fish with a combination of spices, herbs, and other flavorings, such as
  ginger, garlic, onions, and tomatoes. It has a liquid or semi-liquid consistency
  due to the presence of a sauce or gravy that coats the ingredients. There are many
  different types of X in Indian cuisine, each with its unique flavor profile and
  ingredients. On the other hand, Y is a type of X that is made by whisking together
  yogurt, gram flour (besan), and spices and then cooked with a tempering of cumin
  seeds, mustard seeds, and sometimes includes vegetables or dumplings. It has a sour
  and slightly tangy taste due to the use of yogurt and is often served with rice
  or roti.
