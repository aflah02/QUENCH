question: 'At the beginning of the counterculture of the 1960s, Timothy Leary and
  Richard Alpert created a psychedelic training center and international community
  at a coastal town in Mexico, and named their project after its location: Zihuatanejo.
  However, after it gained notoriety as an "LSD Paradise" amongst Mexican media it
  was shutdown by immigration officials in 1963. The town is perhaps best known as
  the place where the protagonist of this box office failure (X) (directed by Frank
  Darabont) convinces his friend to visit him at, after their shared predicament has
  ended, though in reality the scenes showing the town concerned were shot in the
  island of St. Croix in the US Virgin Islands.'
