question: The day started early for all of the fans, most of whom were wearing gold
  and black like Pittsburgh Steelers as all were excited for this match. The fans
  had to battle an early morning traffic jam, rain and extreme heat, but most would
  agree it was worth it for the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Till 12pm of the day,
  the match was peaceful with fans getting wild waving handkerchiefs. But soon, the
  mood of the crowd changed following a horrific never seen before incident (X). Some
  made a run for it, others screamed, some cowered in their seats in utter disbelief.
