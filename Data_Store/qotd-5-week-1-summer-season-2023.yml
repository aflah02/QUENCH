question: X and Y are two classics, ten years apart. They depict reflections on a
  broken connection by the two parties involved. The same actress, who has been the
  highest-paid actress in the world before, plays a leading role in each of the two
  masterpieces. They are inspired by the lives of people who have each won an Oscar
  for Best Original Screenplay. The theme of X and Y is also related to that of a
  famous British memoir from 2016.
