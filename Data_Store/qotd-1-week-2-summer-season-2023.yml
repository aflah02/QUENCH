question: "X\u2019s father, who is a professor in the Civil Engineering Department\
  \ at National Institute of Technology, Surathkal happened to be a college-level\
  \ cricketer himself. He used to idol-worship Y and decided to name his son (X) after\
  \ Y\u2019s son. However, he mistook the first name of Y\u2019s son, thus making\
  \ story quite confusing. Although just like Y, X also went to captain the Indian\
  \ team. X's cricket career started in 2014 and is still ongoing. Y's career as a\
  \ cricketer started in 1971 and ended in 1987."

variable_specific_rationale:
  X: KL Rahul, an Indian cricketer who has been playing for the national team since
    2014, fits the description of X. His father, Dr. KN Ramesh, is a professor in
    the Civil Engineering Department at National Institute of Technology, Surathkal.
    Rahul has been a captain of the Indian team in various formats, including Test
    cricket.
  Y: Sunil Gavaskar, a legendary Indian cricketer who played for the national team
    from 1971 to 1987, fits the description of Y. Gavaskar was known for his batting
    skills and was one of the greatest opening batsmen in Test cricket history. He
    was also a captain of the Indian team and led the team to several victories. Gavaskar's
    son, Rohan Gavaskar, also played cricket and was a member of the Indian team.
    However, Rohan's first name is not the same as KL Rahul's first name, which could
    be a source of confusion.
