question: X first auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club at age 8, but producers told
  X was too young for the show. X's second tryout was successful, and joined Justin
  Timberlake, Christina Aguilera, Ryan Gosling, and a few other budding entertainers
  as Disney's new class of Mouseketeers in 1993. But when the program ended two years
  later, X went home to Louisiana and enrolled in high school. The show didn't immediately
  catapult X to superstardom. X was still practically an unknown when X's first single
  released in 1998.
