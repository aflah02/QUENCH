question: The marble slab that was eventually turned into X by Y in 1504 was cut 43
  years earlier for an artist named Agostino di Duccio, who planned to turn it into
  a statue of Hercules. Di Duccio abandoned his sculpture, which was originally to
  be installed in a Florentine cathedral, and the marble was unused for 10 years until
  another sculptor named Antonio Rossellino, decided to work with it. Rossellino also
  abandoned his work because he found marble too difficult to sculpt, and eventually,
  Y began work on his sculpture in 1501.
