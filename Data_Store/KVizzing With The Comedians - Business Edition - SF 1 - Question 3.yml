question: Andrew X, the son of a farmer, completed his apprenticeship in 1789, established
  a barber's shop in Gerrard Street in Soho, England and began to produce cosmetic
  products. At that time Soho was a high-end residential area, and X's clientele included
  many wealthy socialites who took pride in their appearance. The fashion among the
  wealthy of the period was for pristine white complexions; tanned faces were associated
  with those who laboured outdoors. X found that his powders and creams were frequently
  being used to cover up damage caused by the harshness of the soaps and other beauty
  products (many of which contained arsenic or lead) that were in general use at the
  time. X began to experiment with soap purification and eventually managed to produce
  a gentle soap based on glycerine and other natural products.
