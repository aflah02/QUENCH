question: '* As per one story of Greek mythology, Zeus had announced that whoever
  could devise the most interesting and original dish for his wedding, would be granted
  any favour they pleased. One gooey dish called X was declared the winner and since
  then has been one of the foods of Gods. * At the Olympic Games in ancient Greece,
  this was used as a natural doping agent: the athletes used X in order to regain
  their strength. * X was appreciated as a means of beauty by the ancient civilizations
  and also used for medicinal purposes. * In feudal times in medieval Europe, X was
  used as a source of revenue in the form of a tax, and was gathered by the lords.
  * X comes in different colours, from transparent to almost black. Darker Xs have
  higher antioxidant levels.'
