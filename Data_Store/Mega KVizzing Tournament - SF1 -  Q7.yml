question: In the transformation of this actor into an iconic character (X), the makeup
  artist, John Caglione Jr., faced a significant challenge. The actor's portrayal
  required meticulous attention to detail, especially in choosing the right lipstick.
  Interestingly, the actor personally selected the lipstick for the portrayal, opting
  for Maybelline 49, Rouge Passion Red. This specific shade played a crucial role
  in bringing the larger- than-life character into a more realistic world. Caglione
  Jr. had to balance the untidy and messy appearance of the character without making
  them unrecognizable. The distinct features of the character, including red lips
  allowed for some creative freedom. The actor's long, greasy hair and the uneven,
  messy green dye job contributed to the character's identity.
