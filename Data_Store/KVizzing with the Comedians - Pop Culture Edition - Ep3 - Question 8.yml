question: In the mid-1990s, writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven teamed
  up for a movie (X) about a string of murders in a small California town, and in
  the process reinvented the slasher genre for a cynical audience who thought they
  could see everything coming. Funny, scary, and full of wonderful stylistic flourishes
  from its writer, director, and cast, X is a modern horror classic that changed a
  subgenre forever. X is a 1996 cult-classic.
