question: The earliest archaeological evidence of Xs is found at Dholavira, a Harappan
  city in the modern state of Gujarat. They played a significant role in defining
  subterranean architecture in Western India from the 7th to 19th century. These are
  generally located in three types of places - as an extension or part of a temple,
  in or at an edge of a village, and/or the outskirts of a village. They ensured availability
  of water during periods of drought and played a critical role in serving as a direct
  means to fresh water filtered through the earth.
