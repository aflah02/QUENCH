question: A quiz contest aired on Doordarshan in February 1967, in which participants
  could easily answer questions pertaining to Greek mythology, but were unable to
  reply to the question "In the Ramayana, who was Rama's mother?"- listening to it,
  this person was shocked that Indian students could answer questions on Greek and
  Roman mythology, but were ignorant of their own history, mythology and folklore.
  Thus, in an attempt to teach Indian children about their cultural heritage he started
  this company (X) in 1967.
