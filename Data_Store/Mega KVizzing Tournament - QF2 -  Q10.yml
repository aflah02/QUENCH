question: In recent times, a peculiar and unsightly phenomenon has emerged, turning
  trees into rather unconventional repositories. Certain individuals, prompted by
  a heightened awareness of hygiene during the pandemic, have contributed to the proliferation.
  These trees, adorned with small bags have become a common sight. Despite the availability
  of bins, the bags (containing X) are suspended from branches, often leaving onlookers
  bewildered. The increase in this curious practice has prompted concerns not only
  about cleanliness but also about its environmental impact. Environmental advocates
  have urged everyone to adopt a more responsible approach, emphasizing the potential
  harm to wildlife, ecosystems, and waterways.
