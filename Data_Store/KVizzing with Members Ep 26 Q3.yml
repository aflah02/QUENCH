question: '"In such a remarkably short space of time X has become an iconic figure
  at Y, showing what can be achieved through talent, hard work, and dedication. His
  caring, humble, and engaging off-the- field demeanor has also made him such an impressive
  role model. The 22 shirt has become synonymous with X, his rise to the first team
  aged just 16 years and 38 days and these qualities. And as such, Y has decided it
  would be fitting to retire this number, to remember one of our own and to inspire
  others" X wore 22 since breaking out at Y. X made just 44 appearances before sealing
  a E25 million move to Dortmund. He later continued to wear the same jersey number
  at Borussia Dortmund.'
