question: During the second Australia-Pakistan Test at the MCG, the afternoon session
  on day three encountered an unexpected delay of six minutes. This peculiar interruption
  (X) was caused by none other than third umpire Richard Illingworth, who found himself
  in an unusual predicament. As the players prepared to resume play after the lunch
  break, umpires Joel Wilson and Michael Gough were puzzled by Illingworth's absence
  from his viewing box. This incident prompted Australian opener David Warner to burst
  into laughter when the true reason for the delay was revealed. X is a bizarre yet
  commonplace circumstance
