question: In the world of economics, this beloved novel (X) has served as a timeless
  reference, weaving its character through the intricate fabric of economic theory.
  Its protagonist, after enduring 28 years of solitary existence on an island, becomes
  an unwitting muse for economists. From the pen of Karl Marx to the lectures of Milton
  Friedman, this character embarks on an unexpected journey through the annals of
  economic literature, appearing in "Das Kapital," the "General Theory," and even
  finding a place in Google's chief economist, Hal Varian's, textbook. A one-person
  economy, akin to a certain marooned individual's, becomes a didactic benchmark,
  simplifying the principles of supply and demand. The novel, in its peculiar way,
  raises questions about the harmony of decision-making in more complex economies
  and explores the possibility of replicating this equilibrium
