question: Detective Sam Spade had a lot of speeches in the movie X, which the Warners
  felt tended to slow things down. They asked the director John Huston to pick up
  the pace by having Bogart (and the others) talk faster. Huston, eager to please
  on his first film, took the note to heart and instructed everyone accordingly. When
  X was a hit, the rat-a-tat pace became one of the hallmarks of film noir.
