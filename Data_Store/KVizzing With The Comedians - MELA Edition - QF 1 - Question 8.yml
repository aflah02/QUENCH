variable_specific_rationale:
  X: John Ernst Steinbeck was an American writer. He won the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature
    "for his realistic and imaginative writings, combining as they do sympathetic
    humor and keen social perception." Steinbeck's first novel, Cup of Gold, was published
    in 1929. He studied English Literature at Stanford University from 1919 to 1925
    but left without a degree. When he failed to publish his work while working odd
    jobs in NYC, he returned to California and worked in 1928 as a tour guide and
    caretaker at Lake Tahoe, where he met Carol Henning, his first wife.
