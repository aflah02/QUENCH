question: XY means "impulsive, hasty, or reckless," used especially to describe adventurous
  activities or personages. As Irving wrote in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow," "when
  any XY prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads,
  and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it." The adjective, attested as far
  back as the 1580s in England, derives from the sense of Y as "head," so it's literally
  "crazy in the head."
