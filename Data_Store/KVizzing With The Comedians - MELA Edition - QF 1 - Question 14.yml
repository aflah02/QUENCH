question: "In his lifetime, Rodin made at least 10 castings of X. Upon his death in\
  \ 1917, the rights to recast it were given to the nation of France. Since then,\
  \ that number has grown to over 20. (The exact figure is a matter of debate.) Today,\
  \ plaster and bronze versions of X can be seen in Melbourne's National Gallery of\
  \ Victoria, Geneva's Mus\xE9e d'Art et d'Histoire, Washington D.C.'s National Gallery\
  \ of Art, and Paris' Mus\xE9e Rodin, just to name a few. There's also one that marks\
  \ Rodin's grave."
