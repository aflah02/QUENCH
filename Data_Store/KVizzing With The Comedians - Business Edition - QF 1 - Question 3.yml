question: In 2006, Drew Houston got on a bus from Boston heading to New York. He planned

  he had left his thumb drive with all of his work files at home. Drew decided he
  never wanted to have that problem again. On that bus ride, he started something
  and fourteen years later it became a public company (X) worth close to $8 billion.
