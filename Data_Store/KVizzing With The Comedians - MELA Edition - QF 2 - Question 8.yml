question: The term X is used to describe concepts and situations in which bureaucracies
  overpower people, often in a surreal, nightmarish milieu that evokes feelings of
  senselessness, disorientation, and helplessness. Characters in such a setting often
  lack a clear course of action to escape a labyrinthine situation. Y is an adjective
  describing a situation, idea, or societal condition that is identified as being
  destructive to the welfare of a free and open society. It denotes an attitude and
  a brutal policy of draconian control by propaganda, surveillance, disinformation,
  denial of truth, and manipulation of the past. The New York Times has said the term
  is "the most widely used adjective derived from the name of a modern writer." Both
  X and Y are famous writers.
