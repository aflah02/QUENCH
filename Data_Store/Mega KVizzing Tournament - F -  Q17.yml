question: X's dad had an interesting career path. Born in 1879, Theodor Robert Geisel

  of Forest Park in Springfield, Massachusetts. Among his responsibilities, the elder
  Geisel oversaw the park's onsite zoo. "That zoo," his famous son later remarked,
  "is where I learned whatever I know about animals."
