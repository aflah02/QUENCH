question: "Named after a \u201Cgreat\u201D Greek king, X is a less-known and very\
  \ rarely followed practice that supposedly protects the practicer from Y, by being\
  \ slowly exposed to it. A plot device in fiction and on screen, it is present most\
  \ famously in \u201CThe Count of Monte Cristo\u201D. While its real-world effectiveness\
  \ is much lesser than how much it is shown in fiction, it nevertheless has been\
  \ shown to work in a limited capacity. Some believe that Rasputin\u2019s survival\
  \ of his assassination attempt was due to X, although this has been highly contested."

variable_specific_rationale:
  X: X in this context refers to the practice of mithridatism, named after Mithridates
    VI of Pontus, a notable king in ancient Greek history. Mithridatism is the process
    of gradually ingesting small amounts of a substance, such as poison, to build
    immunity or tolerance to it. The idea is that by exposing oneself slowly to a
    toxic substance, the body can develop defenses against its harmful effects.
  Y: Y, in this case, is poison or a toxic substance. The practice of mithridatism
    is believed to protect the individual from the harmful effects of the poison by
    conditioning the body to withstand it. This concept has been portrayed in various
    works of fiction, including Alexandre Dumas' "The Count of Monte Cristo," where
    the protagonist uses a similar method to build immunity to poison as part of his
    revenge plot.
