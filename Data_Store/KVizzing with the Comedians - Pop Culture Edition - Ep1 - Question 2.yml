question: All the horror in the movie (X) unfolds aboard a spaceship dubbed Nostromo.
  The spaceship's name was ripped from the title of a 1904 novel by Joseph Conrad.
  That's not the movie's only Conrad reference, though. The shuttle that Ripley uses
  to escape is called Narcissus, and that moniker refers to yet another Conrad novel.
  X is a 1979 Ridley Scott sci-fi classic.
