question: "One theory suggests that this was not just a book (X) for the author, it\
  \ was a revenge fantasy he wrote on behalf of his father, a Black general who fought\
  \ in the French Revolution and was ultimately betrayed by Napoleon. There is another\
  \ theory which tells that a character of the book - a mad-genius of a scientist\
  \ who wrote his greatest work in prison, a wrongfully imprisoned man was actually\
  \ based on a real life person - a geologist, who examined, and explained, how volcanoes\
  \ and waters had changed the world over time. The author was buried in the famous\
  \ Panth\xE9on next to other authors like Victor Hugo and \xC9mile Zola."

  X: "The success of The Count of Monte Cristo coincides with France's Second Empire.\
    \ In the novel, Dumas tells of the 1815 return of Napoleon I and resembles contemporary\
    \ events when the governor at the Ch\xE2teau d'If is promoted to a position at\
    \ the castle of Ham. His father, a Haitian of mixed descent, became a successful\
    \ general during the French Revolution.\nFrench President Jacques Chirac acknowledged\
    \ the racism that had existed in France and said that the re-interment in the\
    \ Pantheon had been a way of correcting that wrong, as Alexandre Dumas was enshrined\
    \ alongside fellow great authors Victor Hugo and \xC9mile Zola."
