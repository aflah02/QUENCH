question: X is a type of magazines that were inexpensive and published from 1896 to
  the late 1950s. The term derives from the cheap paper on which the magazines were
  printed. In contrast, magazines printed on higher-quality paper were called "glossies"
  or "slicks." The typical magazine of this kind had 128 pages. The magazines were
  best known for their lurid, exploitative, and sensational subject matter and gave
  rise to a term for run-of-the-mill, low-quality literature which were printed on
  these.
