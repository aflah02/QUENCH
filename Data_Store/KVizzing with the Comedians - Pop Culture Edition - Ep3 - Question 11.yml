question: 'The song Y was written by X at the same desk at which Ian Fleming wrote
  his James Bond novels. X was staying at Fleming''s property GoldenEye in Jamaica
  following the breakdown of his first marriage. In 2019 BMI declared the song the
  most played in radio history. In America, this was the biggest hit of 1983, according
  to Billboard''s year-end chart. It stayed at #1 for eight weeks, longer than any
  other song that year (Michael Jackson''s "Billie Jean" was #2, with a seven-week
  stay). This is one of the most misinterpreted songs ever. It is about an obsessive
  stalker, but it sounds like a love song.'
