question: The pioneering all-female 588th Night Bomber Regiment of the Soviets, dropped
  more than 23,000 tons of bombs on Nazi targets. And in doing so, they became a crucial
  asset in winning World War II. They were feared and hated so much by the Nazis that
  any German airman who downed one was automatically awarded the prestigious Iron
  Cross medal. The Germans nicknamed them the X because the whooshing noise their
  wooden planes made resembled that of a sweeping broom. Despite being the most highly
  decorated unit in the Soviet Air Force during the war, the regiment was disbanded
  six months after the end of World War
