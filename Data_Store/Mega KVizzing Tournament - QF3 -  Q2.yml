question: X made no secret of his fondness for marijuana, which he described as "a
  thousand times better than whiskey." In 1930, when the drug was still not widely
  known, he and drummer Vic Berton were arrested after police caught them smoking
  a joint outside the Cotton Club in California. X served nine days in jail for the
  bust, but despite his brush with law, he continued using marijuana regularly for
  the rest of his life. "It makes you forget all the bad things that happen to a N****"
  he once said.
