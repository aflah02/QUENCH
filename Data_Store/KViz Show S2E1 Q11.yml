question: In the world of cricket, sentiments run high, and players often hold deep
  emotional connections to certain symbols. Former Australian captain Mark Taylor
  once remarked, "The moment you get a X is the moment you have made it," emphasizing
  the prestige attached to this iconic item. Western Australian batsman Michael Hussey
  echoed similar sentiments, describing X as more than just an article of clothing;
  it transcends being a mere piece of fabric. However, there's one cricketing legend
  (Y) who stood in contrast to these emotional attachments. He dismissed X as "a load
  of rubbish" and challenged the notion that wearing it is a prerequisite to expressing
  love for playing cricket for Australia. This individual even criticized former captain
  Steve Waugh for enforcing the use of this item.
