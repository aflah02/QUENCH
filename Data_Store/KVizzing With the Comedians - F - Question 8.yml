question: "The 'X Y Islands' were originally inhabited by the Ciboney and Arawaks,\
  \ with some scholars thinking that the islands were inhabited from as early as 1000\
  \ BC. The Caribs arrived around the mid-15th century AD. Columbus, on his second\
  \ voyage in 1493, is thought to have been the first European to see the islands,\
  \ giving them their current name after the legend of Saint Ursula, who was said\
  \ to be the leader of 11,000 Ys. Denmark\u2014Norway also took an interest in the\
  \ islands, and the Danish West India Company settled there. The islands became royal\
  \ Danish colonies in 1754, named the Danish West Indian islands. During the submarine\
  \ warfare phases of World War l, X, fearing that the islands might be seized by\
  \ Germany as a submarine base, approached Denmark about buying them. After renewed\
  \ attempts by X to purchase the islands, Denmark agreed to sell them in 1916 for\
  \ $25 million."
