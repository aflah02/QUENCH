question: Anthropic, an Al startup and public benefit corporation, was co-founded
  by former OpenAI members, gaining recognition for their generative Al assistant
  'Claude.' This AI, rivaling ChatGPT, is designed to be helpful and harmless. The
  name 'Claude' was strategically chosen as either a nerdy tribute to the 20th-century
  polymath Claude Shannon or a deliberate decision to counterbalance a certain much-
  discussed pattern (X) when it comes to names of AIs.
