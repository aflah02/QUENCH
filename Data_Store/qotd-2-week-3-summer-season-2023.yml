variable_specific_rationale:
  Animal: The animal in question is the horse. In Greek mythology, Poseidon is often
    credited with the creation of horses, and he is known for taming and controlling
    them. The earth-shaking sound associated with backup refers to the sound of hooves,
    specifically the thunderous noise created by a galloping horse. This connection
    between Poseidon, horses, and the powerful sound of their movement ties into the
    mythological aspects of the god's dominion over both the seas and, in a lesser-known
    aspect, his association with earth-shaking phenomena.
