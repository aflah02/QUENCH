question: One month before their departure, these three people (X) had no idea about
  the potential danger of their journey. Being government employees, they were unable
  to purchase life insurance (very expensive at that time). To provide for their families
  in case of disaster, they signed many items and had them posted to their families
  on the day they left. This way, if they did not return, the families could at least
  sell the autographs. Luckily, they did not need the failsafe, and survived the trip.
  This act became a tradition followed by all subsequent people who made a similar
  trip. Who are these people?
