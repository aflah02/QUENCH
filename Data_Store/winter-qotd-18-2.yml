variable_specific_rationale:
  X: Pentagrams were used symbolically in ancient Greece and Babylonia. Christians
    once commonly used the pentagram to represent the five wounds of Jesus. By the
    mid-19th century, a further distinction had developed amongst occultists regarding
    the pentagram's orientation. With a single point upwards, it depicted spirit presiding
    over the four elements of matter and was essentially "good." The inverted pentagram
    is the symbol used for Satanism, sometimes depicted with the goat's head of Baphomet
    within it, which originated from the Church of Satan.
