question: "This problem (X) was so intense that New York Mayor George E. Waring Jr.\
  \ organized the first international congress on urban planning in 1898 (the first\
  \ environmental summit in history), to develop ideas on how to resolve the issue.\
  \ Although the event was majorly a failure due to lack of ideas, measures were put\
  \ in place \u2014 the typical distinctive elevated staircases to the houses in New\
  \ York were born in order to avoid this problem. However, the real solution arrived\
  \ only in 1908 and by 1912, this seemingly insurmountable problem had been resolved\
  \ for good. What problem are we talking about?"
