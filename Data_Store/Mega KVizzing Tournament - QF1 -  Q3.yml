question: This condition (X) bears a name derived from the Ga language of coastal
  Ghana, which translates to "the sickness the baby gets when the new baby comes"
  or "the disease of the deposed child." It manifests in children aged about five
  years old, typically after weaning from breast milk and transitioning to a diet
  rich in carbohydrates like maize, cassava, or rice. The pioneering work of Jamaican
  pediatrician Cicely Williams in 1935 shed light on this affliction, where she became
  the first to distinguish it from other dietary deficiencies and propose a link to
  a deficiency in protein. This condition is marked by edema, an enlarged liver with
  fatty infiltration, and is believed to result from sufficient calorie intake coupled
  with insufficient protein consumption.
