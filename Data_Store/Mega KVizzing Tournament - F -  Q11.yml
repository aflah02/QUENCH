question: "In 2003, 24-year-old machinist Juan Catalan faced the death penalty for\
  \ allegedly shooting a key witness in a murder case. Catalan told police that he\
  \ couldn't have committed the crime\u2014he was at a Los Angeles Dodgers game at\
  \ the time. He had the ticket stubs and everything! When police didn't buy his alibi,\
  \ Catalan contacted the Dodgers, who pointed him to an unlikely hero: the misanthropic\
  \ X. On the day in question, X had been filming an episode of Y in Dodger Stadium.\
  \ It was a long shot, but maybe Catalan could be seen in the background. When his\
  \ attorney watched the outtakes, it took just 20 minutes to find shots of Catalan\
  \ and his daughter chowing down on ballpark dogs while watching from the stands.\
  \ Thanks to the footage, Catalan walked free after five months behind bars. And\
  \ X found one more thing to be self- deprecating about. \"l tell people that I've\
  \ done one decent thing in my life, albeit inadvertently,\" joked X."
