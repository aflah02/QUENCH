question: In 1994, a team led by Masahiro Hara from the Japanese company Denso Wave
  invented X. The initial design was inspired by the black and white pieces on a Go
  Board. They discovered a position detection pattern, which relied on the least used
  ratio in black and white areas on printed materials, effectively avoiding misidentification.
  This ratio was 1:1:3:1:1. To extract the required data, patterns present in both
  the horizontal and vertical components of the image are utilized.
