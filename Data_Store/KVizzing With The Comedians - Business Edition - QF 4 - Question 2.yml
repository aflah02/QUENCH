question: Tennessee bottlers Barney and Ally Hartman developed X as a mixer in the
  1940s. Soft drinks were sold regionally in the 1930s, and the Hartmans had difficulty
  in Knoxville obtaining their preferred soda to mix with liquor, preferably whiskey,
  so the two developed their own. Originally a 19th century slang term for whiskey,
  especially Highland Scotch whiskey, the X name was trademarked for the soft drink
  in 1948.
