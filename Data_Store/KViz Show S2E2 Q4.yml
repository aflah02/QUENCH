question: '"Mindf*ck," written by Christopher Wylie, delves into the Cambridge Analytica
  scandal. In the book, the 8th chapter is named after a 1963 film (part of a broader
  franchise) in a clever play on words. This title (X) hints at the nation often held
  responsible by Americans for the scandal. The altered word in the title points to
  the weapon employed to shape public perception, a characteristic integral to the
  product and company most closely linked to this controversy.'
