question: Luis von Ahn did early pioneering work on CAPTCHA and later founded the
  company reCAPTCHA, which was sold to Google in 2009. He is also the founder of the
  company X. A driving motivation for founding X was Von Ahn's upbringing in Guatemala,
  where he saw how expensive it was for people in his community to learn English.
  Hacker (co-founder and current CTO) believed that "free education will really change
  the world" and wanted to supply people an outlet to do so.
