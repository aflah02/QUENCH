question: LANPAR (LANguage for Programming Arrays at Random), available in 1969, was
  the first of this kind of software (X) on mainframe, whereas VisiCalc (1979) was
  the first on a microcomputer. LANPAR's uniqueness was its incorporation of forward
  referencing/natural order calculation, without which the user had to refresh until
  the values remained unchanged to get a result.
