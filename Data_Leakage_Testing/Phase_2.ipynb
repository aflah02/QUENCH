The etymology associated with uprisings is a fascinating exercise in symbology and the peculiarity of the human mind. For instance, a prominent Soviet revolutionary and later political leader chose the pseudonym X when he was but a teenager as it had a ‘proletarian’ ring. The name X has lived on in the form of an improvised weapon, Y, associated with violent riots. Interestingly, the name Y derives from propaganda broadcast by X during a war, coined by belligerents as a tongue-in-cheek bit of fervid wordplay.',\n",

He took the pseudonym “Molotov”, derived from the Russian word molot (sledge hammer) since he believed that the name had an “industrial” and “proletarian” ring to it.
